Volume Types

emptyDir -- If the Pod is terminated, the content of emptyDir is deleted forever.

hostPath -- shares a directory between host and Pod. If the Pod is terminated, data is still available on the host.

awsElasticBlockStore -- can mount an AWS EBS Volume into a Pod.

secret -- pass sensitive information, such as passwords, to Pods.

configMap -- provide configuration data or shell commands into a Pod.

persistentVolumeClaim -- attach a PersistentVolume to a Pod using a persistentVolumeClaim.

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user.
There are three access modes:
- ReadWriteOnce (read-write by a single node),
- ReadOnlyMany (read-only by many nodes),
- and ReadWriteMany (read-write by many nodes)

Once a suitable PersistentVolume is found, it is bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim.
After a successful bound, the PersistentVolumeClaim resource can be used by the containers of the Pod.

When pod stopped the attached PersistentVolumes can be released. PersistentVolumes can then be:
- reclaimed (for an admin to verify and/or aggregate data),
- deleted (both data and volume are deleted)
- recycled for future usage (only data is deleted)

To determine one of these options need to set persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy
